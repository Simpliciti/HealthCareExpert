# HealthCareExpert

HealthCare Expert is a Java-based program made using simple if and else statements and loops. 
Its function is to take inputs from the user about various health statistics like carbs intake, fat intake, etc. 
Based on this, it prints some information about their health risks on an approximate scale.

The program merely predicts the risk of having health issues based on information from the web and the result comes out to be very accurate most of the time.
